    First of all, let me tell you that earning $100 a day is not an easy job. I was working all day and night with one computer and a desk.

    Making content is not easy and outsourcing is even more difficult. It took me 3 years with consistent efforts and continuous work to reach this height. With rigorous efforts and patience, I was able to build an audience and then started my own website. Then I started making valuable and premium content that my audience wanted and started publishing them on my website. To be honest, the first few days were very hard and crucial at the same read.

    I knew that if I provide value and the best services to people, then I will also get the best of the value and services in return.

Now, I know that I can’t compare to an actual native speaker because I wasn’t raised in an English-speaking country. Still, I do believe that some of the things I’ve done over the years have drastically improved my English language proficiency.

    So, I while back I made a blog about 7 questions you had to answer in the comments( read it here). And I love reading the responses there. So I thought I’d write another blog, now with 5 questions, and again please answer them in the comments : ) !

    What’s your favourite thing you own and why?- For me it would be my PC Setup. I love that thing. No reason in particular, I just happen to be a pc nerd who likes building PCs and having clean setups.
    If you could have dinner with anyone from history, who would it be?- Either Garry Vee or Steph Curry. Garry Vee because I genuinely think he’s a cool dude, and I could probably learn a few things. Steph Curry because he’s my favourite celebrity and I think he’s fun to hang around.
    What’s the worst thing you did as a kid?- I once stole a bakugan( I was a pretty big Bakugan fan back in the day) in kindergarten. The funniest thing here is that I literally told my mom, I stole that. But then I got a lecture on why stealing is bad and I returned it( however I didn’t tell them I stole their toy, rather I made a story up).
    What chore do you absolutely hate doing?- Taking out the trash.
    What is your favourite form of exercise?- Cardio. For some reason.

    Do you use Grammarly?

    If yes, then — Be careful.

    Grammarly — The tool that every writer uses to correct their spelling and grammar mistakes.

    I've been using Grammarly for the last 2 years, but I was not using it primarily for writing. But now, as a writer, I'm using this tool for the last few months on a consistence basis, and I've found it very awful.

    Keep in mind I'm not sponsored by Grammarly, not even reviewing the tool, (also not an affiliate) but here in this post, I’m going to share with you my experience of using Grammarly.

    Because I know most beginner writers also use Grammarly to get help in their writing. So I thought it would be great if I make a post about it.
